# Network-Security-Monitoring-System
A comprehensive network monitoring system that detects and alerts on suspicious activities using Python and open-source security tools.

The Network Security Monitoring System is a robust solution designed to provide real-time visibility into network traffic, detect potential security threats, and alert administrators to suspicious activities. Built with Python and leveraging powerful open-source security tools, this system offers enterprise-grade monitoring capabilities.

The project was developed to address the growing need for proactive network security measures in organizations of all sizes. By analyzing network traffic patterns, identifying anomalies, and correlating events across multiple data sources, the system helps security teams respond quickly to potential threats before they can cause significant damage.
